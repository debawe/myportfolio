            In a very basic example, suppose you want to pick up a relatively heavy reference book. As you touch the book, you are unconsciously evaluating its density and dimensions and getting a sense of its weight. The brain processes this information and adjusts to the appropriate amount of muscular tension needed to lever the book. As you lift the book, your brain ideally continues to take in information about it and adjust muscular tension accordingly so you can lift the book while levering appropriately, and without taxing your lower back, collapsing your wrist, etc.<br><br>
            In short, the nervous system is the information gathering and response system. Because this is very important for understanding body state in terms of nervous system health, I’m going to offer a metaphor that will be applied to other discussions about the nervous system and related topics. You can think about the information gathering part of this system as mail delivery. i.e. the post office delivers

          mail to your mailbox. In the integration step, you read the mail and relate the information to other relevant concepts &#40;do the charges on my credit card match my memory of charges I made?&#41;, and in the response step you respond by paying bills, filing mail, confirming your bank account balance is as it should be, calling to thank a relative for a birthday card, etc. This idea will become more relevant in discussions on the stress and pain management aspects of Holistic Biomechanics&trade;.

            The autonomic nervous system can either be in the the sympathetic nervous system state or the parasympathetic nervous system state. The sympathetic nervous system state is also called fight or flight or, in popular language, the stressed nervous system state. This is optimal for responding to situations of immediate and extreme physical danger, or for investigating whether or not this danger exists. <br>The parasympathetic state is sometimes referred to as the “rest and digest” nervous system state. This state is optimal for times when we don’t need to respond to immediate and extreme physical danger and also allows for optimal functioning of other systems of our body.

        In fight or flight, numerous physiological changes occur that prepare us for fighting, fleeing, playing dead to avoid a predator, or dying &#40;usually as a last resort&#41;. <br><br>Here are some examples of changes that occur&#58;

                  <li><span>The Achilles tendon on the back of the ankle shortens.</span> This protects vital blood flow, or from disabling damage to the ankle that could keep us from moving. As a side effect, this also collapses the bony arch structure of the foot by shifting the position of the heel bone &#40;to which the Achilles is attached&#41;. This can contribute to foot, knee, and hip issues.</li>

Digestion requires a lot of the body’s energy, so this change conserves energy to respond to the immediate crisis at hand. If this continues for a long period of time, this also means that we stop absorbing food, and we may experience irritable bowel syndrome or food allergies.</li>

          Based on the examples of sympathetic nervous system changes above, you can see that many of the changes result in a decrease of sensory information through compressed nerves. Research also shows that endorphins, which are produced in fight or flight, dull sensory signals. In addition, cortisol, which is one of the hormones that increases its presence in the body during fight or flight, breaks down nerve cells.<br>The result of all of this is a substantial decrease of the amount of sensory information to the brain. Going back to the mail delivery metaphor, this means that the mailman has stopped delivering your mail, or is perhaps delivering only sporadically. <br><br>Thus the brain is not receiving sufficient information about the environment and is incapable of responding

      It turns out that receipt of sensory information &#40;the metaphorical mail delivery&#41; is crucial for nervous system health. This is because, in order to appropriately select a nervous system state, the brain needs to know through the receipt of sufficient and accurate sensory information whether or not there is physical danger in the immediate environment. If there is or there may be, then the brain activates the fight or flight nervous system state. <br><br>If the brain receives signals that the body is safe from physical harm, then it is able to select the parasympathetic state. If the brain is not receiving sufficient sensory information, then it will assume there is a problem and activate the fight or flight system. In this way, the physiological and structural changes associated with this nervous system state may persist over time and begin to cause health problems.
